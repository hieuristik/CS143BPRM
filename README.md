# Project & Resource Manager
## Requirements
To ensure that everything works as intended, make sure that your system is utilizing Python 3.12.1+
## How to Use
* Begin by opening the corresponding terminal interface that comes equipped with your OS
* With the terminal open, locate the directory containing the source code of this program within your system
* Run the program by entering the following into the terminal:
```bash
python basic_manager.py
```
> NOTE: The program operates in 2 different modes
> > Mode 1: Semi-Automatic Testing Given an Input File
> >
> > Mode 2: Manual Testing

While the program is running, it will wait for user input. Depending on the type of input, it will make use of the corresponding mode.
* Mode 1 will initiate if the terminal is provided with a path to an input file
* Mode 2 will initiate if the user presses [ENTER] into the terminal

### Testing with Mode 1
If utilizing Mode 1, it is recommended that the input file is placed within the same directory containing the source code. This is not necessary, but recommended since it will allow the user to avoid copying a long path to their designated input file.
* While the program is running, locate the directory containing the input file intended to use for testing
* Copy the path of that input file and provide it as an argument into the terminal
* If the path to the input file is the same as the path to the source code, simply provide the name of the input file itself
> EXAMPLE:
> ```bash
> C:\User\Documents\inputfile.txt
> ```
